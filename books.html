        <h2 class="book-title">Atomic Habits</h2>
        <p class="book-author">by James Clear</p>
        <div class="book-summary">
          <p>A practical guide to building good habits and breaking bad ones through small, incremental changes. Clear's framework shows how tiny adjustments compound into remarkable results over time.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The 1% Rule:</strong> Getting 1% better every day leads to significant improvement over time</li>
            <li><strong>Four Laws of Behavior Change:</strong> Make it obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying</li>
            <li><strong>Environment Design:</strong> Shape your surroundings to support good habits</li>
            <li><strong>Identity-Based Habits:</strong> Focus on who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Application:</h3>
          <p>In my experience leading engineering teams, I've applied the habit stacking technique to build better code review practices. By linking reviews to existing workflows (like morning coffee), teams naturally improved their consistency without feeling burdened.</p>

      <!-- Book 2: Deep Work -->
      <article class="book-card">
        <div class="book-meta">

          <time class="book-date">Nov 2023</time>

        <h2 class="book-title">Deep Work</h2>
        <p class="book-author">by Cal Newport</p>
        <div class="book-summary">
          <p>Newport argues that the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks is becoming increasingly rare—and increasingly valuable. He provides practical strategies for cultivating deep work habits.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep Work Definition:</strong> Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration</li>
            <li><strong>The Shallow Work Problem:</strong> Too much time spent on low-value, easily replicable tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Four Philosophies:</strong> Monastic, bimodal, rhythmic, and journalistic approaches to deep work</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Minimalism:</strong> Carefully curating your digital tools and inputs</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Application:</h3>
          <p>As a tech leader, I've implemented "deep work blocks" for architecture design and strategic planning. By protecting 2-3 hour chunks of uninterrupted time, I've seen measurable improvements in solution quality and decision-making speed.</p>

      <!-- Book 3: The Lean Startup -->
      <article class="book-card">

          <time class="book-date">Oct 2023</time>

        <h2 class="book-title">The Lean Startup</h2>
        <p class="book-author">by Eric Ries</p>
        <div class="book-summary">
          <p>A methodology for developing businesses and products that aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable through validated learning.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Build-Measure-Learn:</strong> The core feedback loop for product development</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP):</strong> The smallest version that enables learning</li>
            <li><strong>Validated Learning:</strong> Progress measured by learning, not just output</li>
            <li><strong>Pivot or Persevere:</strong> Data-driven decisions about changing direction</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Application:</h3>
          <p>I've used lean principles to guide product development at Microsoft, particularly in mobile services. The MVP approach helped us validate customer needs before full-scale development, saving months of work on features that wouldn't have provided value.</p>

      <!-- Book 4: Multipliers -->
      <article class="book-card">
        <div class="book-meta">
          <span class="book-category">Leadership</span>
          <time class="book-date">Sep 2023</time>
        </div>
        <h2 class="book-title">Multipliers</h2>
        <p class="book-author">by Liz Wiseman</p>
        <div class="book-summary">
          <p>Wiseman explores how the best leaders make everyone around them smarter and more capable. She contrasts "Multipliers" who amplify intelligence with "Diminishers" who drain it from their teams.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The Multiplier Effect:</strong> Great leaders get 2x more from their people</li>
            <li><strong>Five Disciplines:</strong> Talent Magnet, Liberator, Challenger, Debate Maker, Investor</li>
            <li><strong>Accidental Diminisher:</strong> Well-meaning behaviors that reduce team effectiveness</li>
            <li><strong>Rookie Smart:</strong> How beginners can outperform experts through fresh thinking</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Application:</h3>
          <p>This book transformed my leadership approach at T-Mobile. Instead of providing solutions, I started asking better questions and creating space for team members to contribute their expertise. The result was more innovative solutions and higher team engagement.</p>

      <!-- Book 5: Zero to One -->
      <article class="book-card">
        <div class="book-meta">
          <span class="book-category">Innovation</span>
          <time class="book-date">Aug 2023</time>
        </div>
        <h2 class="book-title">Zero to One</h2>
        <p class="book-author">by Peter Thiel</p>
        <div class="book-summary">
          <p>Thiel argues that the next great companies will create new things rather than compete in existing markets. He shares insights on building monopolies, the importance of secrets, and thinking independently about the future.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vertical Progress:</strong> Going from "zero to one" creates new value</li>
            <li><strong>Monopoly vs. Competition:</strong> Monopolies capture value; perfect competition destroys it</li>
            <li><strong>The Power of Secrets:</strong> Great companies are built on truths few people believe</li>
            <li><strong>Last Mover Advantage:</strong> Being the last to enter a market can be more valuable than being first</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Application:</h3>
          <p>Working in telecommunications, I've seen how companies that create new categories (like mobile internet) capture more value than those competing in existing ones. This perspective has guided my approach to identifying breakthrough opportunities in emerging technologies.</p>

      <!-- Book 6: Good to Great -->

          <span class="book-category">Business</span>
          <time class="book-date">Jul 2023</time>
        </div>
        <h2 class="book-title">Good to Great</h2>
        <p class="book-author">by Jim Collins</p>
        <div class="book-summary">
          <p>Collins and his research team identified what separates good companies from great ones through rigorous analysis of company performance over decades. The findings challenge conventional wisdom about leadership and strategy.</p>
          
          <h3>Key Insights:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 5 Leadership:</strong> Humility combined with fierce resolve</li>
            <li><strong>The Hedgehog Concept:</strong> Focus on what you can be best at, are passionate about, and drives your economic engine</li>
            <li><strong>Culture of Discipline:</strong> Disciplined people, thought, and action</li>
            <li><strong>The Flywheel:</strong> Sustained effort that builds momentum over time</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Application:</h3>
          <p>The concept of "first who, then what" has guided my hiring philosophy. At Nortel and Siemens, I learned that getting the right people on the team is more important than having the perfect strategy—great people will figure out the strategy.</p>
